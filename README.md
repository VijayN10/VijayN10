## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vijay, a Doctoral Student in the School of Engineering at the University of Manchester, UK. My research focuses on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Machine Learning applications in biomechanics.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing computational models for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m delving into the fundamentals of continuum mechanics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m eager to collaborate on open-source CFD projects and machine learning applications in medical research.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m seeking expertise in integrating machine learning models into CFD simulations.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to discuss OpenFOAM and numerical modeling with me; while I'm continually learning, I enjoy in-depth discussions!
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nandurdikarvijay).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm passionate about applying computational techniques to solve real-world medical problems.
